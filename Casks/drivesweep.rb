  caveats <<~EOS
    DriveSweep is free and open source, but this release is not Apple-notarized.
    Current Homebrew versions have no --no-quarantine install option. After
    reviewing this project, remove the quarantine flag only from this app copy:
      xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DriveSweep.app
    Review https://github.com/naicud/drivesweep/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md
    before bypassing quarantine for any downloaded app.
